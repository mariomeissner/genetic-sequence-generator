# genetic-sequence-generator

Based on the guide I found on this site: http://www.ai-junkie.com/ga/intro/gat1.html
- Running
To run it, you can simply download the files inside bin, and execute index.js with node.js, or in the browser (in that case open the console to view the results). 
- How it works
Genetic algorithm that runs a population of sequences of numbers/operators. Sequences evaluate to a number and the goal is to evolve the sequences until they reach a certain target number. 
- Current state
Sequences converge at some point in most cases, the reason for this is still unclear to me.
